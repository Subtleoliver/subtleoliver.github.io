After a lot of looking into different blog engines I have settled on <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/"><em>Jekyll</em></a> which makes things as simple as possible. <em>Jekyll</em> is what Github uses for it’s pages feature. It is a static site generator that takes what I have written and reads through the directives and puts together my HTML &amp; CSS code based on that.</p> <p>This post is just written in a <em>markdown(.md) file</em> as text with a note at the top that tells it to:</p> <ol> <li>Import the post layout</li> <li>Set the title to “Major Grim to ground control!” And</li> <li>Set the author to Grim. They are saved as variables and when Jekyll comes across a reference to that variable it just replaces it with the corresponding value. Relatively simple stuff.</li> </ol> <p>Anyway, I am not done with the actual coding of this website this is just a basic &amp; clean layout. I still need to add a page for my projects and a few more links at the bottom but soon enough it will all be here (hopefully)</p> <p>// Grim.</p> <p style="text-align: center;">Written 04 Oct 2019 by Grim</p> </div> <div class="Footer"> <p> <a href="https://www.twitter.com/TheGrimsey" title="Twitter Account" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/images/TwitterIcon.png" alt="Twitter Account" class="SocialMediaIcon"></a> <a href="https://www.github.com/TheGrimsey" title="Github Account" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/images/GithubIcon.png" alt="Github Account" class="SocialMediaIcon"></a> </p> Created by TheGrimsey using Jekyll.<br> </div> </body> </html>
