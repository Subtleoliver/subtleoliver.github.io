I have decided to document it on this blog. For this project we will be doing things like <em>Market Research</em> and a bunch more stuff that will be talked about in future posts.</p> <p>I have decided to make or remake an old unity game of mine called <em>Dodger</em> that I made back in 2016 but of course with the extensive knowledge I have accumulated since then and the latest version of <em>Unity</em> (<em>2019.2.12f1</em> at the time of writing).</p> <p>As I mentioned in the first paragraph I am going to be documenting the process on this blog, the 2 first posts (including this one) will probably look a bit different to the following ones this is because after these it will turn more into a journal documenting the journey of making the game from moment to moment. <em>So let’s get started…</em></p> <h3 id="what-was-dodger">What was Dodger?</h3> <p><em>Dodger “Classic”</em> (as I will call it from now on) was a practice project, the first game project I finished and put up somewhere in Unity (I had it on my github.io page for a while before removing it for reasons I don’t remember). I remember trying to make an android version but never finishing it.</p> <p>It was a 2D top-down game where you had a spaceship and dodged asteroids for as long as you could gaining points based on how long you survived, eventually I added the ability to shoot asteroids because my way of spawning them was completely random and would frick you up. It was far from a perfect game and not as fun as it could have been.</p> <p>Here are a few screenshots of Dodger Classic:</p> <div class="ImageFlexBox"> <img src="/assets/images/DodgerV2/Part1/DodgerClassic.jpg" alt="Dodger Classic gameplay" class="SmallPostImage" /> <img src="/assets/images/DodgerV2/Part1/DodgerClassic2.jpg" alt="More Dodger Classic gameplay" class="SmallPostImage" /> <img src="/assets/images/DodgerV2/Part1/DodgerClassicDeathScreen.jpg" alt="Dodger Classic Deathscreen" class="SmallPostImage" /> </div> <h3 id="what-will-dodgerv2-be">What will DodgerV2 be?</h3> <p>For <em>DodgerV2</em> I ironically want to lean less into dodging and more into shooting asteroids. I also want to put it up on the <em>Google Play Store</em> as a mobile game, a PC version is also more than likely.</p> <p>My current vision for the game is that the player has a spaceship that they are flying through an asteroid field, dodging and destroying a large amount asteroids for points. Each asteroid destroyed gives a few points and once you finally exhaust your lives your survival time is added to the score for your total. Taking a hit from an asteroid would take away a life and gives you a short (maybe 0.5 seconds) invulnerability period that you can use to recover.</p> <p>Simple but hopefully fun gameplay, it should at the very least be more interesting than Dodger Classic. Below are a few drafts of gameplay and the main-menu and other ideas for the game.</p> <div class="ImageFlexBox"> <img src="/assets/images/DodgerV2/Part1/DodgerV2GameplayIdea.jpg" alt="DodgerV2 Gameplay Draft" class="SmallPostImage" /> <img src="/assets/images/DodgerV2/Part1/DodgerV2MainMenuIdea.jpg" alt="DodgerV2 MainMenu Draft" class="SmallPostImage" /> <img src="/assets/images/DodgerV2/Part1/DodgerV2CompleteIdeaBoard.jpg" alt="DodgerV2 Full Idea Draft" class="PostImage" /> </div> <p>Looking at the big picture you get a small spoiler for the next post which will talk a bit about Unity and the interesting tech they have that I will be using.</p> <h3 id="click-here-to-go-to-the-next-post-part-2-techstack">Click here to go to the next post: <a href="/2019/11/21/DodgerV2Part2.html">Part 2: “Techstack”</a>.</h3> <p style="text-align: center;">Written 15 Nov 2019 by Grim</p> </div> <div class="Footer"> <p> <a href="https://www.twitter.com/TheGrimsey" title="Twitter Account" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/images/TwitterIcon.png" alt="Twitter Account" class="SocialMediaIcon"></a> <a href="https://www.github.com/TheGrimsey" title="Github Account" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/images/GithubIcon.png" alt="Github Account" class="SocialMediaIcon"></a> </p> Created by TheGrimsey using Jekyll.<br> </div> </body> </html>
