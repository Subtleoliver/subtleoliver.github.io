If someone feels like they want to do something with it they should feel free to do so and as of the time of writing that license has been pushed to the repo.</p> <h3 id="project-specification">Project Specification</h3> <p>What follows is a definition of the project specs (translated into English as the original was in Swedish).</p> <h4 id="1-what-is-dodgerv2">1 What is DodgerV2?</h4> <p>DodgerV2 is a 2D game alike earlier arcade games like Asteroids where you shoot and dodge asteroids to earn points.
