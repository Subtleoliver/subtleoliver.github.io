    <p>Battle For Azeroth is an expansion for Blizzard Entertainment’s World of Warcraft. It has a controversial story. Some people liked it some didn’t. I am gonna try to based on what I think were the problems with it suggest an alternative story for the expansion. This is technically the third draft of this as one I told in discord to a friend and the other I wrote down on twitter a bit later. So let’s jump right in shall we?</p>

    <p>We are getting close to the end, probably. I can’t actually tell with these projects. But the plan for today is to implement mobile controls and to do that I will need to do some refactoring.</p>

    <p>So, last week (when this was written) I was sick that lost me a bit of time. So let’s pick up the pace this time. It’s time to put down just about everything about the project in a collected report that contains every piece of research and work I have done so far then there will be a bit of a pause for christmas break then back to work. I don’t know if I have more to say about this so let’s just get started.</p>

    <p>This is the story of the making of my simple projectile based FPS in Unreal Engine 4. Someone reading this might know that a few <del>weeks</del> months ago I posted this tweet a while back.</p>

    <p>Okay so this post might be a lot less informative and structured. I will be writing it as I go along during class. The plan for today (Thursday 21/11) is to
Structure my storage for this project. 
All the documents I am writing in currently are just dropped into google drive. I am going to move them to a folder shared with my teacher.
Get market research done.
I am gonna spend some time looking through Google Play for 2D games and note some of their statistics like downloads, stars and release date.
Set up Unity project and Github repository.</p>

    <p>In the last post I spoke briefly about the vision I have for the game as well as what Dodger “Classic” was. Today we are going to talk about the tech that will actually drive the gameplay.</p>

    <p>For my “Tech” class (TEKTEK01) we are creating a product and documenting the whole process. I have decided to document it on this blog. For this project we will be doing things like <em>Market Research</em> and a bunch more stuff that will be talked about in future posts.</p>

    <p>So, this is a website!
After a lot of looking into different blog engines I have settled on <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/"><em>Jekyll</em></a> which makes things as simple as possible. <em>Jekyll</em> is what Github uses for it’s pages feature. It is a static site generator that takes what I have written and reads through the directives and puts together my HTML &amp; CSS code based on that.</p>
